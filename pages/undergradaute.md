## Preparing for Law School
Successful law students come from all walks of life and undergraduate backgrounds. Just like Temple’s College of Liberal Arts, law schools value the different perspectives that students bring to the classroom. The American Bar Association (ABA) does not recommend specific undergraduate majors or types of classes, but encourages you to develop critical thinking, sharp research and writing skills. Choose a major you are passionate about, whether it is philosophy or political science and take courses that challenge you.

## Pre-Law Advising
A very important part of success in law school admissions is exceptional advising and mentoring. While there are many paths to prepare for law school, you need good advisors and mentors to help you build your own personal academic and experiential path, and to know how to present your achievements to law schools in the best light. To find out more about Pre-Law in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/), you can contact [CLA academic advising](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/advising) or the Director of Pre-Law in the College of Liberal Arts, [Professor Paul Crowe](mailto:pcrowe@temple.edu).

About 60% of first-year Temple students receive need-based financial aid, and the average first-year financial aid package is about $15,000. Eligible students receive financial assistance from federal, private, state and university sources. Explore your financial aid options and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.
