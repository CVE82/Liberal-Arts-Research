CLA’s Office of Research Administration assists in the administration of sponsored projects in accordance with federal, state, sponsor, and Temple University guidelines. We are dedicated in supporting our faculty in their efforts to seek and obtain external awards to support research, training, community service, and other scholarly activities. We provide support in all aspects of proposal preparation, submission and grant administration. Our staff act as a liaison with many offices outside of CLA that are involved in the life cycle of a grant including OVPR, GMO, RAS, the Graduate School, HR, and more.  We are dedicated to helping you throughout the research process, and are available for consultation on topics including funding searches (link to form), proposal preparation, interpretation of sponsor guidelines, budget development, spending awarded grants, and much more.

### How do I start?
The first step in your grant journey begins with identifying a sponsor and funding opportunity. If you do not already have one, this link provides resources to get you started. CLA’s Research Administration staff are available to assist in this process as well.  Link to funding search form.

All grants must be prepared within Temple’s interactive research portal called Electronic Research Administration [ERA@temple.edu](mailto:ERA@temple.edu). Principal investigators cannot submit applications directly. For detailed information on the grant application process, click here or refer to the Research Guide referenced above. 

### Grant Proposal Deadlines- College & OVPR 
The CLA internal deadlines are as follows:<br>

**7 business days prior to the sponsor deadline:** Administrative items must be received by CLA. This includes the eSPAF (Electronic Sponsored Project Approval Form) final budget, budget justification, biographical sketch or CV, abstract, and other items depending on the submission (subcontractor required forms, current/pending support, and other administrative forms). GMO’s deadline for these materials is 5 business days before the sponsor deadline, however, our office needs the 7 business day deadline to allow for time to review/revise and route the eSPAF for approvals in order to meet the GMO deadline.

**4 business days prior to the sponsor deadline:** Final research plan components are due. GMO’s deadline for these materials is 2 business days before the sponsor deadline. Our 4 business day deadline is in place to give us time to build/review/make edits (when applicable) to proposal components and finalize the record to meet the GMO internal deadline.

These deadlines are vital, as they help us to manage the workflow related to proposal submissions and ensure that everything is in compliance with University and sponsor regulations. If deadlines are conveyed during a meeting, it is important that faculty be made aware that the CLA deadlines are those which need to be followed.  

### I have a grant, now what do I do?
Typically, awards are issued to the university on behalf of the principal investigator. Temple has designated the Grants Management and Research Accounting divisions with responsibility for establishing an account for your award in the university’s financial system (Banner), as well as reviewing and approving expenditures.

Award set up goes through these steps:
- Receipt of official notice of award to Grants Management with copy to principal investigator
- Grants Management review of terms and conditions, including any conditional restrictions – revised budget will likely be necessary at this time
- Internal compliance with all regulatory requirements, such as conflict of interest certification, human subject or animal research protocols
- Development and execution of any contracts or subcontracts, as necessary
- Grants Management transmits entire award package to Research Accounting Services, which issues the account number called a FOAPAL
- Principal investigator and department business staff are notified and work on the project

Once an award is granted and a FOAPAL is established, feel free to contact Kim Fahey to discuss next steps. Your Departmental Business Administrator can assist with payroll paperwork, purchasing through TUMarketplace, and other matters related to spending grant funds.
