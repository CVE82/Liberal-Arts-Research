## What do Pre-Law Students Major In?
Law Schools do not favor any particular major, but rather, look for students with analytical reading comprehension, argumentative writing skills and critical thinking skills. All departments and programs in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) excel in teaching these competencies, which are integral to getting a good score on the LSAT exam — the most crucial factor in law school admissions. Select any of our 35 majors and enhance it with extracurriculars, legal internships and study abroad programs for an undergraduate résumé that stands out to the best law schools. While traditional Pre-Law majors include English, economics, history, philosophy and political science, students from all our majors have been very successful in law school admissions.
