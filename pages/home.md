  We’re not confined to the classroom. We venture into the laboratory
  and get our hands dirty in the field. Whether we’re in the psychology 
  labs of Weiss Hall or analyzing urban sustainability in Center City, our

We’re not confined to the classroom. We venture into the laboratory and get our hands dirty in the field. Whether we’re in the psychology labs of Weiss Hall or analyzing urban sustainability in Center City, our research is driving science forward and changing the world for the better.

The world may be shrinking, but the need for big ideas isn’t. Our students and faculty have always been driven to fix the most pressing global problems with human solutions.

Even a cursory look at the College of Liberal Arts faculty and students reveals the impressive breadth and depth of research that spans the humanities, the social sciences and STEM fields.
