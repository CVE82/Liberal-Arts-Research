  We’re not confined to the classroom. We venture into the laboratory
  and get our hands dirty in the field. Whether we’re in the psychology 
  labs of Weiss Hall or analyzing urban sustainability in Center City, our 
  research is driving science forward and changing the world for the better.

Research in the College of Liberal Arts spans the humanities, arts, social sciences and STEM fields. In _geography_, a new spatial analytics lab provides tools that allow researchers to inform policy in key areas such as health¬care by mapping disease and highlighting geographic health disparities.  Other faculty investigate the social, economic and political impact of the diffusion of new information tech¬nologies in the U.S. and across the world. They probe the depths of higher education funding and marry computer science and literature through the _digital humanities_. Our _philosophy_ faculty does cutting-edge research in the area of biomedical ethics, changing the way we understand the relationship between medicine and our values. Our _religion_ professors write award-winning books that bring new understandings of racial dynamics in American religious history.

Members of our _psychology_ faculty, one of the finest in the country, lead in the study of anxiety disorders, child development and human cognition. Using our new func¬tional MRI research center, they will break new ground in understanding the early impact of trauma on developing brains. Our _political scientists_ study how to promote democracy around the world, while military historians conduct interdisciplinary research on the historic and contemporary use of force and diplomacy in a global context—a timely specialty in today’s world. Temple’s _criminal justice_ scholars pursue smarter ways to man¬age probation, resulting in smaller prison populations and safer communities.  These examples, represent a small fraction of our output.
