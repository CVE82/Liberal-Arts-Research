## Pre-Law Student Organizations
The College offers a range of student-run activities of interest to pre-law students, including

## Temple University Pre-Law Society
[Pre-Law Society](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/prelaw_society) meets regularly throughout the semester and is open to all majors. Apart from social events, the society hosts speakers such as CLA alumni lawyers and law students, law school admissions officers and LSAT prep organizations. The Society also organizes visits to law schools and law school fairs in the area, as well as LSAT practice exams and study-groups. Pre-law Society is a great way to meet other Pre-Law students at Temple.

## Temple University Mock Trial Team
The College of Liberal Arts has supported a successful mock trial for many years. Every year, two teams from Temple enter the national American Mock Trial Association Competition and compete against teams from the region. [Temple Mock Trial](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/tumocktrial) teams regularly compete against (and defeat) teams from NYU, Princeton, University of Maryland, Villanova, Yale and others. The team’s two coaches are both practicing lawyers and alums of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law’s nationally ranked [Trial Advocacy Program](https://www.law.temple.edu/academics/areas-of-study/trial-advocacy/).

## Temple University Debate Team
The [Temple Debate Society](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/templedebate) competes on the most popular circuit inthe United States, the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA), but we encourage all types of public discourse, both competitive and non-competitive. The purpose of this organization is to develop debate and speech skills both among its members and the local community. The team provides access for its members to compete and/or participate in debate, forensics and speech tournaments, including those held on a national and international level.

## Temple University Black Law Students Association
The [Black Law Student Association - Pre-Law Division](https://www.law.temple.edu/academics/intellectual-life/student-organizations/) (BLSA) is a student organization dedicated to making pre-law students more competitive law school applicants. The organization confronts the high racial disparity in the legal field by preparing pre-law students to attend law school.
